<p> This website is where I keep my portfolio, and projects that I have worked on. Mostly, this will be for employers who want to learn a little bit more about me and to give them a better understanding of who I am. If this is you, hopefully this will quicken the your employing process, whether it be at my gain or loss; I believe that time is precious, and I don't want to waste any of yours. For those of you who are not employers, I hope you also enjoy my website!</p>

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Sun Jack Chen (as you can tell from the title), but I prefer to be called Jack. I am a 1B Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a Bachelors' and possible a Master's. I am proficient in Java, C, C++, and have experience with other languages and programs: C#,HTML/CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and Android Development.</p>

<p> I love coding; I always loved building things, and when I learned that you can build something so great by juxtaposing the right words the right way. Outside of coding and school, I have many interests. I am an avid fan of sports; I play tennis and go to the gym often. I also watch tennis, hockey, and basketball, and my favourite player/team for each is Rafael Nadal, Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors/Dallas Mavericks/Dirk Nowitzki respectively. Like many programmers that I know, I also love video games. Most programmers probably started of playing video games and thought of designing their own, so they started to self-learn. Some games I play are League of Legends and OSU, and Dragon Age Origins, Witcher 2/3, Age of Mythology are amongst my favourite games of all time. I also like reading manga, and watching anime; some favourites are Akgame ga Kiru, and Clannad. I like all types of music, but Rap and Rock are probably are my favourite genres. Lastly, my favourite animal is a Sperm Whale.</p>
